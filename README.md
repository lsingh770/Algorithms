# Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of algorithm implementations in Java.
And also certain practice samples.

## Project Structure

- **src/main**: Contains the Java source code for various algorithms.

## Getting Started

To run the algorithms locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lsingh770/Algorithms.git
   cd Algorithms
    ```

2. **Build the project:** Use the provided Gradle wrapper to build the project
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

3. **Run the algorithms:** Execute the desired algorithm using
    ```bash
    java -cp build/classes/java/main <package_name>.<ClassName>
    ```
    Replace `<package_name>` and `< ClassName >` with the appropriate values.
## Prerequisites
